# C# and Razor Style Guidelines

All code contributions and AI-generated code must follow these style rules:

- **Indentation:** Use tabs for all C# and Razor files.
- **Brace Style:** Use One True Brace Style (1TBS) â€” opening braces on the same line.
- **One-line Returns/Lambdas:** Prefer one-line returns and expression-bodied members (lambdas) where possible.
- **Namespace Style:** Use file-scoped namespaces (`namespace MyNamespace;`).
- **Max Line Length:** 140 characters.
- **String Quotes:** Use double quotes for strings (C# default).
- **Naming:** Private fields should be _camelCase.
- **End of File:** Always end files with a newline.
- **Encoding:** Use UTF-8.
- **Razor Files:** Apply the same indentation and line length rules as C#.

> These rules are enforced in `.editorconfig` at the project root. All agents and contributors must follow them for consistency.

For reference, see `.editorconfig` in the project root.
